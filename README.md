# Sketches
Hi everyone,
This is a simple repository holding all of my sketches that I have done so far mainly in p5js.
For my first sketch, it shows a stylized personal portrait with a boucing around line that is supposed to show
like a barrier to self experssion.

For this to run, the live server and p5vscode extensions or similar software need to be downloaded as this repo displays p5js sketches in a simple website.
